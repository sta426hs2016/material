# Part 1 - Brainstorm: Statistics

## Distributions
### e.g., Gaussian, Poisson, ..

## Statistical Models
## Methods for Estimation
## Methods for Hypothesis Testing

# Part 2 - Brainstorm: Technologies in Biology

## microarray, sequencing, etc.

## In-class exercise 1 (1 technology for each row): microarray, Illumina seq, other types of seq

### Goal: 
#### produce a 2-3 point summary
#### links to a few (<5) good resources
#### add your description to the #technology_day slack channel (add all github usernames of your group!)

# Part 3 - Brainstorm: Applications in genomics 

### e.g., gene expression

# Part 4 - Brainstorm: Linking Technologies to Applications to Statistics (mainstream)

## e.g., microarray -> gene expression -> normally distributed (log intensities)

## In-class exercise 2 (in groups/rows): 
### Goal: make the link between technologies, what is measured, statistical models used
### For example:
##### RNA-seq: sequencing -> gene expression -> ?
##### BS-seq: bisulphite + sequencing -> DNA methylation -> ?
##### ChIP-seq: sequencing -> protein/DNA interactions -> ?


# Part 5 - Brainstorm: Methods/algorithms/data structures that are associated more to computer science

# Part 6 - Pick another "technology" (from those above or from [1]) to briefly describe

## In-class exercise 3 (in groups): 
### Goal: 
#### write ~2 sentences about what the method does
#### again, make the link (technology -> application -> statistics)
#### list the github usernames of everyone in your group
#### submit a pull request to brainstorm_answers.md

The method introduces a mutated transposon to a collection of species to mark the DNA. After the selection of specific genes, the DNA is collected and by sequencing, the loci of transposons determine which genes have been essential for survival.

Sequencing, qPCR -> fitness-related gene identification -> Bayesian model using MCMC, z-test, principle coordinate analysis, q-values
